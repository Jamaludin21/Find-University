Test for React.js developer (Find-University)

Create web based application using React.JS
where involving:

- creating React component with props, state, and event handling
- integrating CSS (CSS in JS or styled-components) into React component
- fetching data from Public API and displaying it within React component (you can using free public
  API ex: Weather API, OMDB, etc)
- creating unit testing using a testing library like Jest or React testing library
- writing clean, maintainable and well-documented react code

After finish upload code to GitHub (don't forget to include .env file)

NOTE: unit test still buggy but other I think its already as requirement.

Thanks
